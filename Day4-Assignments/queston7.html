    <h3>Question 7</h3>
    <p>
    <pre>
     An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything
	 except 1 and itself.

	 In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.

	 For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.

	 Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.

	 For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.

     P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value
